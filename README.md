# SOR Hydrogen Keyboard
The Hydrogen is my first custom mechanical keyboard, heavily inspired by the [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd?tab=readme-ov-file). It is a thin, split, wireless ergonomic board designed specifically to match the stagger and splay of my fingers. The Hydrogen uses hotswappable Kalih Choc V2 switches, and is designed for use with low profile keycaps.
